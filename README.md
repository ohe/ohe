### Hi there, I'm Olivier! I am an (old) software engineer and CTO of Smart Flows. üëã

üë®‚Äçüíº As a manager, here is what you can expect:

- my role is not to tell you what you should do. Actually, it is the opposite. Tell me what we should change and I will help you to make that change happen
- my Comcolors profile is Green / Purple. It means:
  - that I need space. As a consequence, my behavior may let you think I'm distant. I'm not! Do not hesitate to make contact
  - that I have a strong value system: trustworthiness and accountability are very important to me
- 1:1 is your time, please use it to the fullest, if you don't, I will not force you
- I'm a slow thinker. I often need time to give you the appropriate answer

I am good at debugging/finding new angles to solve an issue.
I am bad at keeping a backlog clean (it bothers me a lot)

üë®‚Äçüíª As a software engineer, my areas of expertise are displayed below. Yes, there are only a few, but I'm confident that you will always learn things from me on these technologies.

Aside from my daily job, I enjoy reading ([what I've read so far in 2022](https://lnk.gleeph.net/lFYWsZecgob)), listening to music (most of the time Indie Rock). I am also learning Japanese, Rust, and Solidity
